[4] Force-removing __pycache__ from index (if any):
No __pycache__ to remove

[5] Git status after aggressive cleanup:
On branch main
Your branch and 'origin/main' have diverged,
and have 6 and 2 different commits each, respectively.
  (use "git pull" if you want to integrate the remote branch with yours)

Untracked files:
  (use "git add <file>..." to include in what will be committed)
	cleanup.log
	cleanup.sh
	cleanup_aggressive.log
	cleanup_aggressive.sh

nothing added to commit but untracked files present (use "git add" to track)
